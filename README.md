To test, go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, select "Load Temporary Add-on," and upload this as a ZIP file.

This is a semi-beta add-on. Feel free to do whatever you want with it, but I am not responsible for any actions taken using it (yes, it's open source LOL).

I'm not a programmer and just made this for myself, but if someone else finds it useful, feel free to try it out. 

As soon as Firefox finishes the review, I will add a link to the official add-on website.
